# Ballerina Container based Performance Tests

This repository contains container based performance tests for Ballerina. The tests are running in an AKS cluster.

### Adopting load tests for standard libraries

1. All the tests in the standard library should reside inside `load-tests` directory in the repository root.

2. Create a directory inside `load-tests` for the test. We will call it `test_sample` here.

3. The test should have four directories inside.
    1. deployment
    2. results
    3. scripts
    4. src
   
4. The `src` directory should contain the ballerina package that has to be load tested.
   This project should have `cloud = "k8s"` entry inside Ballerina.toml and it should have Cloud.toml file to 
   configure the docker and  Kubernetes artifacts.

```toml
[container.image]
repository= "ballerina" # Do not change this entry.
name="test_sample" # Docker image name should be same as package name

[cloud.deployment] 
# Resource Allocations Change these according to your scenario needs
# min_memory="256Mi" 
# max_memory="512Mi"
# min_cpu="200m"
# max_cpu="500m"
[cloud.deployment.autoscaling]
# min_replicas=1
# max_replicas=1
```
3. The `deployment` directory should contain the additional kubernetes artifacts that should be applied on top of 
   c2c genrated yaml. This will be done using Kustomize. `ingress.yaml` and `kustomization.yaml` is mandatory here. 
   You can add any additional yamls you require for the deployment in this directory (helper pods, mysql etc).
   
kustomization.yaml
```yaml
resources:
  - test_sample.yaml # this is the name of generated yaml from c2c. you can execute bal build on the src dir to find the exact name
  - ingress.yaml
```
ingress.yaml
```yaml
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test_sample
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-passthrough: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: bal.perf.test
    http:
      paths:
      - path: "/"
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: sample-svc # generated service name from c2c. you might need to verify this by manually reading the generated yaml.
            port:
              number: 9090
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - "bal.perf.test"

```
4. The `scripts` directory is used to hold the scripts required for load test execution. It must contain run.sh file 
   which will be responsible for running the load test. You can include the .jmx file and access it via the 
   directory via $scriptsDir variable in the run.sh file. 
   
   You can additionally have `pre_run.sh` (ex - to install dependencies for required test) and `post_run.sh` (ex - 
   to modify results csv) in the same directory.
   
Sample run.sh file
```bash
set -e
source base-scenario.sh

jmeter -n -t "$scriptsDir/"http-post-request.jmx -l "$resultsDir/"original.jtl -Jusers=50 -Jduration=1200 -Jhost=bal.perf.test -Jport=443 -Jprotocol=https -Jpath=passthrough $payload_flags
```
5. The `results` directory should contain summary.csv file with the following header. Results of the tests will be 
   appended to this file.
```csv
Label,# Samples,Average,Median,90% Line,95% Line,99% Line,Min,Max,Error %,Throughput,Received KB/sec,Std. Dev.,Date,Payload,Users
```

6. When your test is ready, you can commit your test suite for any repository under `ballerina-platform` and execute 
   https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-performance-cloud/actions/workflows/stdlib_workflow.yml by giving 
   the repository name as an input.
